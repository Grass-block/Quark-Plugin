What is the aim of this plugin?

- A compound management plugin...
- A set of toolbox and some randomly features...
- A set of game features add and tweaks...

This is a compound plugin which means it is similar to essentials,but it does more.
you can easily create a lobby or a game server using it.
All these features(80+)are organized in jar-package-module layers,which means you can customize its function by enable
or disable modules,add or remove extension packs,or even make your own pack through sdk pack.

## Installation

1. download the latest `quark-core.jar`, all things need it to work.
2. if your server is not based on bukkit, install `quark-platform.jar`
3. choose to install packages of your need.
4. reload the server
5. enjoy it :D

## Update

1. download latest `quark-core.jar`, always keep it in latest version.
2. type `/quark reload`,if you find error, update target pack.
3. if you didn't change i18n files, type `/quark language restore-all` to update files.

## Compatibility

> We STRONGLY recommend you to use paper based server to enable full features.
> it could work on other platform, but who knows what will happen?
